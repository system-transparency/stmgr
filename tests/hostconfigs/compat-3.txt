This file is representative of what is provisioned on a real system, thanks
vistor at Mullvad VPN for contributing it.  It contains roughly the same
abandoned, incompatible, and missing fields as the compat-{1,2}.txt.  The
difference is that this configuration is even older and not aware of
"network_interfaces", "bonding_mode", "bond_name" (and so doesn't set them).
