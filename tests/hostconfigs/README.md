# Host configurations

This directory contains a sample of host configurations (modulo a few
placeholder values like USER and PASSWORD) that are checked for validity in our
CI pipelines.  It is recommended that users of ST check that all of their host
configurations remain valid as new software versions become available.

Users of ST are encouraged to contribute host configurations to this directory,
as it helps us with regression testing and understanding our user's deployments.
Provide a brief description before the JSON blob, see example in compat-1.txt.
