NEWS for stmgr v0.3.x

    Incompatible changes:

    * Generation of UKI files no longer defaults to using
      /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.efi.stub. It now defaults to
      a stub file embedded at stmgr compile time. (See uki/stub/README
      for which version is embedded).

    * The out-of-date "stmgr provision" sub command has been deleted.

    New features and improvements:

    * Signing OS packages (stmgr ospkg sign) can now use ssh-agent to
      access the private signing key, see docs/manual.md.

    * Creating certificates (stmgr keygen certificate) used to always
      create a new keypair as part of the process. That key generation
      is now optional. More precisely, a root certificate can be
      created for a private key specified with the -rootKey option,
      including support for ssh-agent to access the private key. A
      leaf certificate can be created with the new -leafKey option
      specifying the public key to be certified.

    * Validating host config (stmgr hostconfig check) updated to match
      recent changes in stboot, including backwards compatibility.
      Submission of additional host config files to check in stmgr
      regression tests are welcome.

    * The command "stmgr uki create" can now optionally sign the
      generated UKI for Secure Boot; new flags: -signkey, -signcert.

    * Improved documentation, new docs/manual.md.

    Miscellaneous:

    * Improved integration tests.
