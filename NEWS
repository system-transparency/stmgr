NEWS for stmgr v0.3.x

    This release is an update to match the stboot-0.3.x release. The
    main new features relate to signing: UKI executables can now be
    signed for Secure Boot. Signatures on OS Packages and certificates
    can now use private keys accessed via the ssh-agent protocol,
    enabling use of keys residing on a more secure hardware device.

    Breaking changes:

    * Generation of UKI files no longer defaults to using
      /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.efi.stub. It now defaults to
      a stub file embedded at stmgr compile time. (See uki/stub/README
      for which version is embedded).

    * The out-of-date "stmgr provision" subcommand has been deleted.

    New features and improvements:

    * Signing OS packages (stmgr ospkg sign) can now use ssh-agent to
      access the private signing key, see docs/manual.md.

    * Creating certificates (stmgr keygen certificate) used to always
      create a new keypair as part of the process. That key generation
      is now optional. More precisely, a root certificate can be
      created for a private key specified with the -rootKey option,
      including support for ssh-agent to access the private key. A
      leaf certificate can be created with the new -leafKey option
      specifying the public key to be certified.

    * Validating host config (stmgr hostconfig check) updated to match
      recent changes in stboot, including backwards compatibility.
      Submission of additional host config files to check in stmgr
      regression tests are welcome.

    * The command "stmgr uki create" can now optionally sign the
      generated UKI for Secure Boot; new flags: -signkey, -signcert.

    * Improved documentation, new docs/manual.md.

    Miscellaneous:

    * Improved integration tests.

    Compatibility:

    * This release implements the specifications at
        https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/docs/-/tree/v0.2.0/content/docs/reference

    * Artifacts generated by this release of stmgr are tested with
      stboot-v0.3.6.
